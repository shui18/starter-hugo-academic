abstract: In this paper, based on the exponential integrator, a new Jacobi-type iteration method is proposed for solving linear system Ax = b. The traditional Jacobi iteration method can be viewed as a special case of the new method. The convergence and two comparison theorems of the new Jacobi-type method are established for linear system with diferent type of coefcient matrices. The convergence of the traditional Jacobi iteration method follows immediately from these results. It is shown that for the linear system with coefcient matrix that is M-matrix or nonnegative matrix, the new method is convergent. Under suitable conditions, the spectral radius of iteration matrix for new method is much smaller than traditional Jacobi method 
for the case of nonnegative coefcient matrix. Numerical experiments are carried out to show the efectiveness of the new method when dealing with the nonnegative matrix system.
