abstract: In this paper, a new iterative refnement for ill-conditioned linear systems is derived based on discrete gradient methods for gradient systems. It is proved that the new method is convergent for any initial values irrespective of the choice of the stepsize h. Some properties of the new iterative refnement are presented. It is shown that the condition number of the coefcient matrix in the linear system to be solved in every step can be improved signifcantly compared with Wilkinson's iterative refnement. The numerical experiments illustrate that the new method is more efective and effcient than Wilkinson's iterative refnement when dealing with ill-conditioned linear systems.
