abstract: This article presents a new analytical formula for the Cauchy problem of the wave equation with variable coefficients, which is a much simpler solution than that given by the Poisson formula. The derivation is based on the variation-of-constants formula and the theory of pseudodifferential operator. The formula is applied to an example to illustrate the feasibility.
