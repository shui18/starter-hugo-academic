abstract: The multi-frequency and multi-dimensional adapted Runge-Kutta-Nystr¨om (ARKN)
integrators, and multi-frequency and multi-dimensional extended Runge-Kutta-Nystr¨om
(ERKN) integrators have been developed to efficiently solve multi-frequency oscillatory
Hamiltonian systems. The aim of this paper is to analyze and derive high-order symplectic and symmetric composition methods based on the ARKN integrators and ERKN
integrators. We first consider the symplecticity conditions for the multi-frequency and
multi-dimensional ARKN integrators. We then analyze the symplecticity of the adjoint integrators of the multi-frequency and multi-dimensional symplectic ARKN integrators and
ERKN integrators, respectively. On the basis of the theoretical analysis and by using the
idea of composition methods, we derive and propose four new high-order symplectic and
symmetric methods for the multi-frequency oscillatory Hamiltonian systems. The numerical results accompanied in this paper quantitatively show the advantage and efficiency of
the proposed high-order symplectic and symmetric methods.
