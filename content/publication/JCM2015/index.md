abstract: The multi-frequency and multi-dimensional adapted Runge-Kutta-Nystr$\ddot{o}$m (ARKN) integrators, and multi-frequency and multi-dimensional extended Runge-Kutta-Nystr$\ddot{o}$m (ERKN) integrators have been developed to efficiently solve multi-frequency oscillatory Hamiltonian systems. The aim of this paper is to analyze and derive high-order symplectic and symmetric composition methods based on the ARKN integrators and ERKN integrators. We first consider the symplecticity conditions for the multi-frequency and multi-dimensional ARKN integrators. We then analyze the symplecticity of the adjoint integrators of the multi-frequency and multi-dimensional symplectic ARKN integrators and ERKN integrators, respectively. On the basis of the theoretical analysis and by using the idea of composition methods, we derive and propose four new high-order symplectic and symmetric methods for the multi-frequency oscillatory Hamiltonian systems. The numerical results accompanied in this paper quantitatively show the advantage and efficiency of the proposed high-order symplectic and symmetric methods.
