abstract: Includes recent advances in the ARKN methods, ERKN methods, two-step ERKN methods, trigonometric Fourier collocation methods, energy-preserving methods etc. Includes new and important development of the error analysis for ERKN methods and two-step ERKN methods. Lays emphasis on the structure-preserving properties and computational efficiency of newly developed integrators
