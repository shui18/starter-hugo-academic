abstract = {In this paper, we present a new analytical formula for the Cauchy problem of the linear inhomogeneous wave equation with variable coefficients. The formula gives a much simpler solution than that given by the classical Poisson formula. The derivation is based on Duhamelâ€™s Principle and the theory of pseudodifferential operator. An example is solved by using the formula to illustrate the feasibility.}
