## Course Description

This course covers error analysis, floating-point arithmetic, polynomial interpolation, and numerical differentiation and integration.

## Textbooks
The required textbook is Explorations in Numerical Analysis by James V. Lambers and Amber C. Sumner. Additional reading material will be listed [here](https://lxy.nau.edu.cn/_s26/2021/1029/c1039a87015/page.psp).
## Coursework
The coursework will consist of written homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a comprehensive final exam.
## Grading
The overall grade for the course is determined by weighting each of the homework assignments and exams as follows:
- Homework and Quizzes	30%
- Midterm Exam	30%
- Final Exam	40%
Letter grades are based on a ``straight scale''. If a student is unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond his or her control, the instructor may assign a grade of incomplete.
## Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will know how to:
- Write programs in MATLAB, including those that implement numerical algorithms
- Determine whether a mathematical problem is well- or ill-conditioned
- Determine whether a mathematical expression is susceptible to issues with floating-point arithmetic, and if so, modify the expression to remedy such issues
- Construct, update, and analyze the accuracy of a polynomial or piecewise polynomial that interpolates given data points
- Construct and analyze the accuracy of numerical methods for approximating a derivative of a function at a given point, or a definite integral of a function over an interval
- Use iteration to compute a solution of a nonlinear equation
- Select the most effective numerical method for a given problem based on an understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods presented, and general principles of error analysis.
