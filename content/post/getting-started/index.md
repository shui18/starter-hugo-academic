## Course Description

This course covers error analysis, floating-point arithmetic, polynomial interpolation, and numerical differentiation and integration.



## Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will know how to:
- Write programs in MATLAB, including those that implement numerical algorithms
- Determine whether a mathematical problem is well- or ill-conditioned
- Determine whether a mathematical expression is susceptible to issues with floating-point arithmetic, and if so, modify the expression to remedy such issues
- Construct, update, and analyze the accuracy of a polynomial or piecewise polynomial that interpolates given data points
- Construct and analyze the accuracy of numerical methods for approximating a derivative of a function at a given point, or a definite integral of a function over an interval
- Use iteration to compute a solution of a nonlinear equation
- Select the most effective numerical method for a given problem based on an understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods presented, and general principles of error analysis
