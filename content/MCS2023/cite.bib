abstract = {In this paper, we first derive the energy-preserving collocation integrator for solving the hyperbolic Hamiltonian systems. Then, two concrete high-order energy-preserving and symmetric integrators are presented by choosing the collocation nodes as two and three Gauss–Legendre points, respectively. The convergence and the symmetry of the constructed energy-preserving integrators are rigorously analysed. Numerical results verify the energy conservation property and the accuracy of the proposed integrators.}
